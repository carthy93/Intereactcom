## How I built this project from scratch

## Day 1

- Analysed the existing project
- Sketched the layout roughly in my notebook
- Installed the necessary packages
- Started with the UI
- In this project I have a chatbot design where it would be visble on the right bottom corner
- For styles I used tailwind css

- Continued working on the UI and started to implement the api integration
- open and conversations api integarted and looped according and displayed on the frontend
- installed redux/toolkit and worked on persisting the conversation which we do
- started with new chat interaction

## Day 3

- worked on sockets debugging on the Intercom AI chatbot application
- I was not able to get the sockets data when I hit the api from react frontend which is very challenging for me. I spent more time on this for this particular day
- Tried implementing the same in the react application
- Formatted the code
